Redux Store

This is an e-commerce app which has been refactored to utilize Redux instead of a Context API to access data. The functionality of the app is the same, except the way the app determines changes to its global state involves passing reducers to a Redux store instead of using Context API; also, the app now uses Redux instead of Context API to extract store data and to dispatch actions.

If you would like to see a working version of the Redux-infused app, you can access it [here](https://guarded-cliffs-68452.herokuapp.com/).
